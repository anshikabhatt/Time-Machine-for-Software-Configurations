This above link is my contribution to the task #T331202. In this task, I created a new Git repository that tracks changes to a CSV file containing a simple data structure of city names and their corresponding temperatures. The repository consists of several Git commits that record changes to this data, including adding and removing rows. Using Git's version control system, each commit captures a snapshot of the data in its current state at a specific point in time. This allows me to easily track changes to the data over time and revert to previous versions if needed.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                         To parse this data, my_parser file reads the data into a native structure in memory, and timemachine.rb file plays back the git history, storing the entire sequence in  memory with timestamps for each commit. The resulting flat structure includes the commit timestamp and all data for that commit repeated in the same format as the original CSV.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
#Getting Started
To use this program, you must have Ruby installed on your machine. You can install Ruby by following the instructions on the official Ruby website.

After installing Ruby, you can download the code from this repository and run it on your local machine.

#Usage
To use the time machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the my_parser.rb script to generate a CSV file with temperature data.
2. Run the time_machine.rb script to take snapshots of the data at different points in time. 
3. Run the data_timestamps.rb script to print out the snapshots and their timestamps.

#Setting Up the Target Repository
To set up the target repository, you need to make sure that it is a Git repository.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your target repository.
2. Initialize the Git repository by running the following command:
  git init 
  
3. Add the files that you want to track to the repository by running the following commands:  
  git add 
  
4. Commit the changes by running the following command:
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

Now, your target repository is ready to be tracked by the Time Machine for Software Configurations. 

Note: Make sure to commit any changes in the target repository before running the Time Machine script.
