This above link is my contribution to the task #T331202. In this task, I created a new Git repository that tracks changes to a CSV file containing a simple data structure of city names and their corresponding temperatures. The repository consists of several Git commits that record changes to this data, including adding and removing rows. Using Git's version control system, each commit captures a snapshot of the data in its current state at a specific point in time. This allows me to easily track changes to the data over time and revert to previous versions if needed.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                         To parse this data, my_parser file reads the data into a native structure in memory, and timemachine.rb file plays back the git history, storing the entire sequence in  memory with timestamps for each commit. The resulting flat structure includes the commit timestamp and all data for that commit repeated in the same format as the original CSV.
