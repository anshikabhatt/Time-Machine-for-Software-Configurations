# Time-Machine-for-Software-Configurations
This repository tracks the evolution of language support for machine translations and other software features over time. Using a simple data structure stored in a CSV file, this tool records changes in the configuration of language support by making git commits with added or removed rows. A parser written in Ruby reads the data into a native structure in memory, and a "time machine" plays back the git history, storing the entire sequence in memory with timestamps for each commit. The resulting flat structure includes the commit timestamp and all data for that commit repeated in the same format as the original CSV.
